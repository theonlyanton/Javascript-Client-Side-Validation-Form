# Javascript Client Side Form

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/theonlyanton/pen/abwEKaE](https://codepen.io/theonlyanton/pen/abwEKaE).

I created a simple login form with four different attributes in addition to adding form validation on the client side using Javascript. Two different styles exist for the inputs: success and error - this corresponding with the two different states that the inputs can have.
